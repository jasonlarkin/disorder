	abstract = {We demonstrated nanoscale solid-state thermal rectification. High-thermal-conductivity carbon and boron nitride nanotubes were mass-loaded externally and inhomogeneously with heavy molecules. The resulting nanoscale system yields asymmetric axial thermal conductance with greater heat flow in the direction of decreasing mass density. The effect cannot be explained by ordinary perturbative wave theories, and instead we suggest that solitons may be responsible for the phenomenon. Considering the important role of electrical rectifiers (diodes) in electronics, thermal rectifiers have substantial implications for diverse thermal management problems, ranging from nanoscale calorimeters to microelectronic processors to macroscopic refrigerators and energy-saving buildings.},

Low thermal conductivity is critical in a broad range of energy conversion technologies, including thermoelectrics and thermal barrier coatings. Here, we review the chemical trends and explore the origins of low thermal conductivity in crystalline materials. A unifying feature in the latest materials is the incorporation of structural complexity to decrease the phonon velocity and increase scattering. With this understanding, strategies for combining these mechanisms can be formulated for designing new materials with exceptionally low thermal conductivity.},

	abstract = {Through numerical simulation and consideration of phonon scattering by two-level states, the heat conductivity κ(T), where T is temperature, has been calculated on model structures. The values obtained are in good quantitative agreement with measured data on polymethylmethacrylate, epoxy, amorphous selenium, and amorphous silicon dioxide over the temperature range 0.1 to 100 K. The calculated results reproduce the plateau feature, in the range of 5 to 20 K, that is generic to the heat conductivity of amorphous solids. Two model parameters, one characterizing the degree of structural disorder and the other related to the relaxational absorption of two-level states, are identified as being responsible for the behavior of κ(T) at T ≥ 5 K. The simulation results indicate the existence of a frequency-independent phonon diffusion regime that is consistent with the minimum phonon mean-free-path hypothesis. The magnitude of the phonon diffusion constant in this regime is shown to give a reasonable quantitative account of high-temperature κ(T) in amorphous systems.},

High-thermal-conductivity carbon and boron nitride nanotubes were mass-loaded externally and inhomogeneously with heavy molecules. The resulting nanoscale system yields asymmetric axial thermal conductance with greater heat flow in the direction of decreasing mass density. The effect cannot be explained by ordinary perturbative wave theories, and instead we suggest that solitons may be responsible for the phenomenon. Considering the important role of electrical rectifiers (diodes) in electronics, thermal rectifiers have substantial implications for diverse thermal management problems, ranging from nanoscale calorimeters to microelectronic processors to macroscopic refrigerators and energy-saving buildings.},

	abstract = {The scattering of lattice waves by static imperfections is treated by second-order perturbation theory. The transition matrix is composed of contributions due to the mass difference of lattice points, changes in the elastic constants of linkages between lattice points, and elastic strain. Point imperfections are shown to scatter as the fourth power of frequency, dislocations as the first power, and grain boundaries independently of frequency. The magnitude of the scattering cross section is estimated for a variety of lattice defects in alkali halides, for screw and edge dislocations and for grain boundaries. These results are discussed in relation to thermal conduction by the lattice at low temperatures.},

High-thermal-conductivity carbon and boron nitride nanotubes were mass-loaded externally and inhomogeneously with heavy molecules. The resulting nanoscale system yields asymmetric axial thermal conductance with greater heat flow in the direction of decreasing mass density. The effect cannot be explained by ordinary perturbative wave theories, and instead we suggest that solitons may be responsible for the phenomenon. Considering the important role of electrical rectifiers (diodes) in electronics, thermal rectifiers have substantial implications for diverse thermal management problems, ranging from nanoscale calorimeters to microelectronic processors to macroscopic refrigerators and energy-saving buildings.},

The positive sign unambiguously indicates p-type (hole) conduction in these heterojunctions, whereas the Au Fermi level position for Au-{BDT-Au} junctions was identified to be 1.2 {eV} above the highest occupied molecular orbital level of {BDT.} The ability to study thermoelectricity in molecular junctions provides the opportunity to address these fundamental unanswered questions about their electronic structure and to begin exploring molecular thermoelectric energy conversion.},

	abstract = {Substitutional solid solutions that exist in both ordered and disordered states will exhibit markedly different physical properties depending on their exact crystallographic configuration. Many random substitutional solid solutions (alloys) will display a tendency to order given the appropriate kinetic and thermodynamic conditions. Such order–disorder transitions will result in major crystallographic reconfigurations, where the atomic basis, symmetry, and periodicity of the alloy change dramatically. Consequently, the dominant scattering mechanism in ordered alloys will be different than that in disordered alloys. In this study, we present a hypothesis that ordered alloys can exhibit lower thermal conductivities than their disordered counterparts at elevated temperatures. To validate this hypothesis, we investigate the phononic transport properties of disordered and ordered {AB} Lennard-Jones alloys via non-equilibrium molecular dynamics and harmonic lattice dynamics calculations. It is shown that the thermal conductivity of an ordered alloy is the same as the thermal conductivity of the disordered alloy at ≈0.6 T melt and lower than that of the disordered alloy above 0.8 T melt .},

High-thermal-conductivity carbon and boron nitride nanotubes were mass-loaded externally and inhomogeneously with heavy molecules. The resulting nanoscale system yields asymmetric axial thermal conductance with greater heat flow in the direction of decreasing mass density. The effect cannot be explained by ordinary perturbative wave theories, and instead we suggest that solitons may be responsible for the phenomenon. Considering the important role of electrical rectifiers (diodes) in electronics, thermal rectifiers have substantial implications for diverse thermal management problems, ranging from nanoscale calorimeters to microelectronic processors to macroscopic refrigerators and energy-saving buildings.},

	abstract = {Substitutional solid solutions that exist in both ordered and disordered states will exhibit markedly different physical properties depending on their exact crystallographic configuration. Many random substitutional solid solutions (alloys) will display a tendency to order given the appropriate kinetic and thermodynamic conditions. Such order–disorder transitions will result in major crystallographic reconfigurations, where the atomic basis, symmetry, and periodicity of the alloy change dramatically. Consequently, the dominant scattering mechanism in ordered alloys will be different than that in disordered alloys. In this study, we present a hypothesis that ordered alloys can exhibit lower thermal conductivities than their disordered counterparts at elevated temperatures. To validate this hypothesis, we investigate the phononic transport properties of disordered and ordered {AB} Lennard-Jones alloys via non-equilibrium molecular dynamics and harmonic lattice dynamics calculations. It is shown that the thermal conductivity of an ordered alloy is the same as the thermal conductivity of the disordered alloy at ≈0.6 T melt and lower than that of the disordered alloy above 0.8 T melt .},

High-thermal-conductivity carbon and boron nitride nanotubes were mass-loaded externally and inhomogeneously with heavy molecules. The resulting nanoscale system yields asymmetric axial thermal conductance with greater heat flow in the direction of decreasing mass density. The effect cannot be explained by ordinary perturbative wave theories, and instead we suggest that solitons may be responsible for the phenomenon. Considering the important role of electrical rectifiers (diodes) in electronics, thermal rectifiers have substantial implications for diverse thermal management problems, ranging from nanoscale calorimeters to microelectronic processors to macroscopic refrigerators and energy-saving buildings.},

	abstract = {The results of numerical work on the Anderson model of disordered systems are presented. The sensitivity of the eigenvalues to the choice of periodic or antiperiodic boundary conditions is used as a criterion for localization, and the theory of this criterion is discussed. For the two dimensional square lattice this criterion gives a reasonably sharp result for the onset of localization which is not in conflict with other criteria of localization, and it is found that localization occurs far more easily than Anderson's theory suggests. For the diamond lattice the onset of localization is less sharply defined, and localization occurs less easily than for the square lattice, but more easily than in Anderson's theory.},

For the two dimensional square lattice this criterion gives a reasonably sharp result for the onset of localization which is not in conflict with other criteria of localization, and it is found that localization occurs far more easily than Anderson's theory suggests. For the diamond lattice the onset of localization is less sharply defined, and localization occurs less easily than for the square lattice, but more easily than in Anderson's theory.},

	doi = {10.1126/science.253.5019.539},
	abstract = {Through numerical simulation and consideration of phonon scattering by two-level states, the heat conductivity κ(T), where T is temperature, has been calculated on model structures. The values obtained are in good quantitative agreement with measured data on polymethylmethacrylate, epoxy, amorphous selenium, and amorphous silicon dioxide over the temperature range 0.1 to 100 K. The calculated results reproduce the plateau feature, in the range of 5 to 20 K, that is generic to the heat conductivity of amorphous solids. Two model parameters, one characterizing the degree of structural disorder and the other related to the relaxational absorption of two-level states, are identified as being responsible for the behavior of κ(T) at T ≥ 5 K. The simulation results indicate the existence of a frequency-independent phonon diffusion regime that is consistent with the minimum phonon mean-free-path hypothesis. The magnitude of the phonon diffusion constant in this regime is shown to give a reasonable quantitative account of high-temperature κ(T) in amorphous systems.},

Low thermal conductivity is critical in a broad range of energy conversion technologies, including thermoelectrics and thermal barrier coatings. Here, we review the chemical trends and explore the origins of low thermal conductivity in crystalline materials. A unifying feature in the latest materials is the incorporation of structural complexity to decrease the phonon velocity and increase scattering. With this understanding, strategies for combining these mechanisms can be formulated for designing new materials with exceptionally low thermal conductivity.},

High-thermal-conductivity carbon and boron nitride nanotubes were mass-loaded externally and inhomogeneously with heavy molecules. The resulting nanoscale system yields asymmetric axial thermal conductance with greater heat flow in the direction of decreasing mass density. The effect cannot be explained by ordinary perturbative wave theories, and instead we suggest that solitons may be responsible for the phenomenon. Considering the important role of electrical rectifiers (diodes) in electronics, thermal rectifiers have substantial implications for diverse thermal management problems, ranging from nanoscale calorimeters to microelectronic processors to macroscopic refrigerators and energy-saving buildings.},

The transition matrix is composed of contributions due to the mass difference of lattice points, changes in the elastic constants of linkages between lattice points, and elastic strain. Point imperfections are shown to scatter as the fourth power of frequency, dislocations as the first power, and grain boundaries independently of frequency. The magnitude of the scattering cross section is estimated for a variety of lattice defects in alkali halides, for screw and edge dislocations and for grain boundaries. These results are discussed in relation to thermal conduction by the lattice at low temperatures.},

We carried out a detailed atomistic study of the thermal conductivity, using molecular dynamics and the Boltzmann transport equation, and we investigated in detail the effects of the physical approximations underlying each approach, as well as the effect of the numerical approximations involved in the implementation of the two different methods. Our findings permitted to understand and reconcile apparently conflicting results reported in the literature.},

	abstract = {We experimentally measure the density of states ({DOS)} and dynamical structure factor ({DSF)} arising from the thermal fluctuations in a colloidal crystal composed of thermally sensitive micron-sized hydrogel particles at several different particle volume fractions, ϕ’s. Particle positions are tracked over long times using optical microscopy and particle tracking algorithms in a single two-dimensional ({2D)} [111] plane of a {3D} face-centered-cubic single crystal. The dynamical fluctuations are spatially heterogeneous while the lattice itself is highly ordered. At all ϕ’s, the {DOS} exhibits an excess of low frequency modes, a so-called boson peak ({BP)}, and the {DSF} exhibits a cross-over from propagating to nonpropagating behavior, a so-called Ioffe-Regel crossover, at a frequency somewhat below the {BP} for both longitudinal and transverse modes. As we tune ϕ from 0.64 to 0.56, the Lindemann parameter grows from {\textasciitilde}3\% to {\textasciitilde}8\%; however, the shape of the {DOS} and {DSF} remain largely unchanged when rescaled by the Debye level. This invariance indicates that the effective degree of disorder remains essentially constant even in the vicinity of melting.},

Low thermal conductivity is critical in a broad range of energy conversion technologies, including thermoelectrics and thermal barrier coatings. Here, we review the chemical trends and explore the origins of low thermal conductivity in crystalline materials. A unifying feature in the latest materials is the incorporation of structural complexity to decrease the phonon velocity and increase scattering. With this understanding, strategies for combining these mechanisms can be formulated for designing new materials with exceptionally low thermal conductivity.},

Our findings permitted to understand and reconcile apparently conflicting results reported in the literature.},

Low thermal conductivity is critical in a broad range of energy conversion technologies, including thermoelectrics and thermal barrier coatings. Here, we review the chemical trends and explore the origins of low thermal conductivity in crystalline materials. A unifying feature in the latest materials is the incorporation of structural complexity to decrease the phonon velocity and increase scattering. With this understanding, strategies for combining these mechanisms can be formulated for designing new materials with exceptionally low thermal conductivity.},

High-thermal-conductivity carbon and boron nitride nanotubes were mass-loaded externally and inhomogeneously with heavy molecules. The resulting nanoscale system yields asymmetric axial thermal conductance with greater heat flow in the direction of decreasing mass density. The effect cannot be explained by ordinary perturbative wave theories, and instead we suggest that solitons may be responsible for the phenomenon. Considering the important role of electrical rectifiers (diodes) in electronics, thermal rectifiers have substantial implications for diverse thermal management problems, ranging from nanoscale calorimeters to microelectronic processors to macroscopic refrigerators and energy-saving buildings.},

The sensitivity of the eigenvalues to the choice of periodic or antiperiodic boundary conditions is used as a criterion for localization, and the theory of this criterion is discussed. For the two dimensional square lattice this criterion gives a reasonably sharp result for the onset of localization which is not in conflict with other criteria of localization, and it is found that localization occurs far more easily than Anderson's theory suggests. For the diamond lattice the onset of localization is less sharply defined, and localization occurs less easily than for the square lattice, but more easily than in Anderson's theory.},

High-thermal-conductivity carbon and boron nitride nanotubes were mass-loaded externally and inhomogeneously with heavy molecules. The resulting nanoscale system yields asymmetric axial thermal conductance with greater heat flow in the direction of decreasing mass density. The effect cannot be explained by ordinary perturbative wave theories, and instead we suggest that solitons may be responsible for the phenomenon. Considering the important role of electrical rectifiers (diodes) in electronics, thermal rectifiers have substantial implications for diverse thermal management problems, ranging from nanoscale calorimeters to microelectronic processors to macroscopic refrigerators and energy-saving buildings.},

The transition matrix is composed of contributions due to the mass difference of lattice points, changes in the elastic constants of linkages between lattice points, and elastic strain. Point imperfections are shown to scatter as the fourth power of frequency, dislocations as the first power, and grain boundaries independently of frequency. The magnitude of the scattering cross section is estimated for a variety of lattice defects in alkali halides, for screw and edge dislocations and for grain boundaries. These results are discussed in relation to thermal conduction by the lattice at low temperatures.},

High-thermal-conductivity carbon and boron nitride nanotubes were mass-loaded externally and inhomogeneously with heavy molecules. The resulting nanoscale system yields asymmetric axial thermal conductance with greater heat flow in the direction of decreasing mass density. The effect cannot be explained by ordinary perturbative wave theories, and instead we suggest that solitons may be responsible for the phenomenon. Considering the important role of electrical rectifiers (diodes) in electronics, thermal rectifiers have substantial implications for diverse thermal management problems, ranging from nanoscale calorimeters to microelectronic processors to macroscopic refrigerators and energy-saving buildings.},

	abstract = {We experimentally measure the density of states ({DOS)} and dynamical structure factor ({DSF)} arising from the thermal fluctuations in a colloidal crystal composed of thermally sensitive micron-sized hydrogel particles at several different particle volume fractions, ϕ’s. Particle positions are tracked over long times using optical microscopy and particle tracking algorithms in a single two-dimensional ({2D)} [111] plane of a {3D} face-centered-cubic single crystal. The dynamical fluctuations are spatially heterogeneous while the lattice itself is highly ordered. At all ϕ’s, the {DOS} exhibits an excess of low frequency modes, a so-called boson peak ({BP)}, and the {DSF} exhibits a cross-over from propagating to nonpropagating behavior, a so-called Ioffe-Regel crossover, at a frequency somewhat below the {BP} for both longitudinal and transverse modes. As we tune ϕ from 0.64 to 0.56, the Lindemann parameter grows from {\textasciitilde}3\% to {\textasciitilde}8\%; however, the shape of the {DOS} and {DSF} remain largely unchanged when rescaled by the Debye level. This invariance indicates that the effective degree of disorder remains essentially constant even in the vicinity of melting.},

	abstract = {The control of heat conduction through the manipulation of phonons as coherent waves in solids is of fundamental interest and could also be exploited in applications, but coherent heat conduction has not been experimentally confirmed. We report the experimental observation of coherent heat conduction through the use of finite-thickness superlattices with varying numbers of periods. The measured thermal conductivity increased linearly with increasing total superlattice thickness over a temperature range from 30 to 150 kelvin, which is consistent with a coherent phonon heat conduction process. First-principles and Green’s function–based simulations further support this coherent transport model. Accessing the coherent heat conduction regime opens a new venue for phonon engineering for an array of applications.},

The values obtained are in good quantitative agreement with measured data on polymethylmethacrylate, epoxy, amorphous selenium, and amorphous silicon dioxide over the temperature range 0.1 to 100 K. The calculated results reproduce the plateau feature, in the range of 5 to 20 K, that is generic to the heat conductivity of amorphous solids. Two model parameters, one characterizing the degree of structural disorder and the other related to the relaxational absorption of two-level states, are identified as being responsible for the behavior of κ(T) at T ≥ 5 K. The simulation results indicate the existence of a frequency-independent phonon diffusion regime that is consistent with the minimum phonon mean-free-path hypothesis. The magnitude of the phonon diffusion constant in this regime is shown to give a reasonable quantitative account of high-temperature κ(T) in amorphous systems.},

	abstract = {Substitutional solid solutions that exist in both ordered and disordered states will exhibit markedly different physical properties depending on their exact crystallographic configuration. Many random substitutional solid solutions (alloys) will display a tendency to order given the appropriate kinetic and thermodynamic conditions. Such order–disorder transitions will result in major crystallographic reconfigurations, where the atomic basis, symmetry, and periodicity of the alloy change dramatically. Consequently, the dominant scattering mechanism in ordered alloys will be different than that in disordered alloys. In this study, we present a hypothesis that ordered alloys can exhibit lower thermal conductivities than their disordered counterparts at elevated temperatures. To validate this hypothesis, we investigate the phononic transport properties of disordered and ordered {AB} Lennard-Jones alloys via non-equilibrium molecular dynamics and harmonic lattice dynamics calculations. It is shown that the thermal conductivity of an ordered alloy is the same as the thermal conductivity of the disordered alloy at ≈0.6 T melt and lower than that of the disordered alloy above 0.8 T melt .},

Thus, graphene can be useful in solving heat dissipation problems such as those in nanoelectronics. However, contact with a substrate could affect the thermal transport properties of graphene. Here, we show experimentally that ? of monolayer graphene exfoliated on a silicon dioxide support is still as high as about 600 watts per meter per kelvin near room temperature, exceeding those of metals such as copper. It is lower than that of suspended graphene because of phonons leaking across the graphene-support interface and strong interface-scattering of flexural modes, which make a large contribution to ? in suspended graphene according to a theoretical calculation.},

The as-synthesized oxide nanobelts are pure, structurally uniform, and single crystalline, and most of them are free from defects and dislocations. They have a rectanglelike cross section with typical widths of 30 to 300 nanometers, width-to-thickness ratios of 5 to 10, and lengths of up to a few millimeters. The beltlike morphology appears to be a distinctive and common structural characteristic for the family of semiconducting oxides with cations of different valence states and materials of distinct crystallographic structures. The nanobelts could be an ideal system for fully understanding dimensionally confined transport phenomena in functional oxides and building functional devices along individual nanobelts.},

Low thermal conductivity is critical in a broad range of energy conversion technologies, including thermoelectrics and thermal barrier coatings. Here, we review the chemical trends and explore the origins of low thermal conductivity in crystalline materials. A unifying feature in the latest materials is the incorporation of structural complexity to decrease the phonon velocity and increase scattering. With this understanding, strategies for combining these mechanisms can be formulated for designing new materials with exceptionally low thermal conductivity.},

	abstract = {Mitigation of the global energy crisis requires tailoring the thermal conductivity of materials. Low thermal conductivity is critical in a broad range of energy conversion technologies, including thermoelectrics and thermal barrier coatings. Here, we review the chemical trends and explore the origins of low thermal conductivity in crystalline materials. A unifying feature in the latest materials is the incorporation of structural complexity to decrease the phonon velocity and increase scattering. With this understanding, strategies for combining these mechanisms can be formulated for designing new materials with exceptionally low thermal conductivity.},

Low thermal conductivity is critical in a broad range of energy conversion technologies, including thermoelectrics and thermal barrier coatings. Here, we review the chemical trends and explore the origins of low thermal conductivity in crystalline materials. A unifying feature in the latest materials is the incorporation of structural complexity to decrease the phonon velocity and increase scattering. With this understanding, strategies for combining these mechanisms can be formulated for designing new materials with exceptionally low thermal conductivity.},

	abstract = {Substitutional solid solutions that exist in both ordered and disordered states will exhibit markedly different physical properties depending on their exact crystallographic configuration. Many random substitutional solid solutions (alloys) will display a tendency to order given the appropriate kinetic and thermodynamic conditions. Such order–disorder transitions will result in major crystallographic reconfigurations, where the atomic basis, symmetry, and periodicity of the alloy change dramatically. Consequently, the dominant scattering mechanism in ordered alloys will be different than that in disordered alloys. In this study, we present a hypothesis that ordered alloys can exhibit lower thermal conductivities than their disordered counterparts at elevated temperatures. To validate this hypothesis, we investigate the phononic transport properties of disordered and ordered {AB} Lennard-Jones alloys via non-equilibrium molecular dynamics and harmonic lattice dynamics calculations. It is shown that the thermal conductivity of an ordered alloy is the same as the thermal conductivity of the disordered alloy at ≈0.6 T melt and lower than that of the disordered alloy above 0.8 T melt .},

	abstract = {Using harmonic and anharmonic force constants extracted from density functional calculations within a supercell, we have developed a relatively simple but general method to compute thermodynamic and thermal properties of any crystal. First, from the harmonic, cubic, and quartic force constants, we construct a force field for molecular dynamics. It is exact in the limit of small atomic displacements and thus does not suffer from inaccuracies inherent in semiempirical potentials such as Stillinger-Weber's. By using the Green-Kubo formula and molecular dynamics simulations, we extract the bulk thermal conductivity. This method is accurate at high temperatures where three-phonon processes need to be included to higher orders, but may suffer from size scaling issues. Next, we use perturbation theory (Fermi golden rule) to extract the phonon lifetimes and compute the thermal conductivity κ from the relaxation-time approximation. This method is valid at most temperatures, but will overestimate κ at very high temperatures, where higher-order processes neglected in our calculations also contribute. As a test, these methods are applied to bulk crystalline silicon, and the results are compared and differences are discussed in more detail. The presented methodology paves the way for a systematic approach to model heat transport in solids using multiscale modeling, in which the relaxation time due to anharmonic three-phonon processes is calculated quantitatively, in addition to the usual harmonic properties such as phonon frequencies and group velocities. It also allows the construction of an accurate bulk interatomic potentials database.},

The sensitivity of the eigenvalues to the choice of periodic or antiperiodic boundary conditions is used as a criterion for localization, and the theory of this criterion is discussed. For the two dimensional square lattice this criterion gives a reasonably sharp result for the onset of localization which is not in conflict with other criteria of localization, and it is found that localization occurs far more easily than Anderson's theory suggests. For the diamond lattice the onset of localization is less sharply defined, and localization occurs less easily than for the square lattice, but more easily than in Anderson's theory.},

A record-low conductivity value in air at 300 K of λ ≈ 0.012 watt per meter per kelvin was found for ρ ≈ 157 kilograms per cubic meter. Caloric measurements under variation of gas pressure as well as spectral infrared transmission measurements allowed the determination of solid conductivity, gaseous conductivity, and radiative conductivity as a function of density. The development of such low conductivity materials is of great interest with respect to the substitution of environmentally harmful insulating foams made from chlorofluorocarbons.},

The values obtained are in good quantitative agreement with measured data on polymethylmethacrylate, epoxy, amorphous selenium, and amorphous silicon dioxide over the temperature range 0.1 to 100 K. The calculated results reproduce the plateau feature, in the range of 5 to 20 K, that is generic to the heat conductivity of amorphous solids. Two model parameters, one characterizing the degree of structural disorder and the other related to the relaxational absorption of two-level states, are identified as being responsible for the behavior of κ(T) at T ≥ 5 K. The simulation results indicate the existence of a frequency-independent phonon diffusion regime that is consistent with the minimum phonon mean-free-path hypothesis. The magnitude of the phonon diffusion constant in this regime is shown to give a reasonable quantitative account of high-temperature κ(T) in amorphous systems.},

Our model explicitly accounts for the Umklapp scattering process and electronâ€“phonon coupling effects in the calculation of the phonon scattering rates. The role of the electronâ€“phonon coupling in the heat transport is relatively small for large silicon nanowires. It is found that the effect of the electronâ€“phonon coupling on the thermal conduction is enhanced as the diameter of the silicon nanowires decreases. Electrons in the conduction band scatter low-energy phonons effectively where surface modes dominate, resulting in a smaller thermal conductivity. Neglecting the electronâ€“phonon coupling leads to overestimation of the thermal transport for ultra-thin {SiNWs.} The detailed study of the phonon density of states from the surface atoms and central atoms shows a better understanding of the nontrivial size dependence of the heat transport in silicon nanowire.},

Low thermal conductivity is critical in a broad range of energy conversion technologies, including thermoelectrics and thermal barrier coatings. Here, we review the chemical trends and explore the origins of low thermal conductivity in crystalline materials. A unifying feature in the latest materials is the incorporation of structural complexity to decrease the phonon velocity and increase scattering. With this understanding, strategies for combining these mechanisms can be formulated for designing new materials with exceptionally low thermal conductivity.},
